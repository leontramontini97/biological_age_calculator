# Questionnaire-Based Biological Age Calculator

This tool provides a way to estimate biological age based on lifestyle, behavioral, and health factors without requiring laboratory biomarker measurements. It offers a complementary approach to the biomarker-based Klemera-Doubal method.

## Overview

While biomarker-based methods like Klemera-Doubal provide precise biological age estimates, they require laboratory testing that may not be accessible to everyone. This questionnaire-based tool offers a practical alternative that can:

1. Provide a rough estimate of biological age based on scientifically-established lifestyle and health factors
2. Identify areas where changes could potentially improve longevity
3. Generate personalized recommendations for healthy aging
4. Visualize results in an intuitive way

The calculator considers factors across multiple domains:
- Personal characteristics
- Physical activity and fitness
- Nutrition and diet
- Medical health
- Lifestyle habits
- Psychological well-being
- Social connections

## Scientific Background

The weights assigned to different responses in the questionnaire are based on scientific literature regarding factors associated with longevity and aging. The impact scores reflect the scientific consensus on how various lifestyle and health factors influence aging and mortality risk.

Key factors include:
- Physical activity (associated with 20-30% reduction in all-cause mortality)
- Smoking status (shortens life expectancy by approximately 10 years)
- Social connections (strong social ties associated with 50% increased survival)
- Sleep duration (both too little and too much sleep associated with increased mortality)
- Diet quality (Mediterranean and plant-based diets associated with longevity)
- Body mass index (obesity associated with accelerated aging)
- Chronic disease burden (multimorbidity accelerates functional decline)
- Psychological well-being (positive affect associated with longevity)

## How It Works

The calculator uses a simple algorithm to adjust your chronological age based on your questionnaire responses:
1. Each response has an "impact score" (negative values are beneficial, positive values are detrimental)
2. The total impact is calculated and scaled to generate a biological age estimate
3. The difference between biological and chronological age indicates your "aging pace"
4. Category-specific scores help identify areas for potential improvement

## Usage

### Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Dependencies: numpy, pandas, matplotlib

### Installation

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

### Running the Calculator

1. **As a standalone tool:**
   ```bash
   python questionnaire_bioage.py
   ```
   This will run with example values and generate a sample report.

2. **Integrate into your own code:**
   ```python
   from questionnaire_bioage import QuestionnaireAgeCalculator
   
   # Initialize the calculator
   calculator = QuestionnaireAgeCalculator()
   
   # Get questions for creating your own interface
   questions = calculator.get_questions()
   
   # Provide responses (these are example values)
   responses = {
       'age': 45,
       'sex': 'male',
       'sleep': '7-8',
       'smoking': 'never',
       'alcohol': 'moderate',
       'exercise': 'moderate',
       # ... add more responses ...
   }
   
   # Calculate biological age
   results = calculator.calculate_biological_age(responses)
   
   # Generate recommendations
   recommendations = calculator.generate_recommendations(results)
   
   # Create visualization
   fig = calculator.plot_results(results)
   fig.savefig('my_biological_age.png')
   ```

### Sample Output

The calculator produces:
1. A numerical biological age estimate
2. An "aging pace" (difference between biological and chronological age)
3. A qualitative interpretation of the aging pace
4. Category-specific scores to identify areas for improvement
5. Personalized recommendations based on your results
6. Visualizations for easier interpretation

## Comparison with Biomarker-Based Methods

| Feature | Questionnaire-Based | Biomarker-Based (e.g., Klemera-Doubal) |
|---------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Precision | Moderate | High |
| Accessibility | High (no lab tests needed) | Lower (requires specific biomarker tests) |
| Cost | Free | Potentially expensive |
| Scientific validation | Moderate | High |
| Personalization | Based on lifestyle factors | Based on physiological measures |
| Recommendations | Directly actionable | May require medical interpretation |

## Limitations

1. This tool provides an estimate only and should not be considered a medical diagnosis
2. The weights are based on population-level statistical associations and may not account for individual variations
3. Some important factors (like genetics) are only indirectly assessed
4. Self-reported data may be subject to recall bias or inaccuracies
5. This is not a substitute for proper medical evaluation and care

## Future Development

Potential enhancements for future versions:
- Integration with fitness tracker data for objective activity measurements
- Expanded questionnaire with additional validated factors
- Machine learning model to refine weights based on longitudinal outcomes
- Web or mobile interface for easier access
- Ability to track changes in biological age over time
